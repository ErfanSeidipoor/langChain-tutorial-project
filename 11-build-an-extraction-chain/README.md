# Project: Information Extraction with LangChain and Zod

This project demonstrates how to use LangChain and Zod to build a robust
information extraction pipeline.

## Key Features

### Zod Schema Validation

- Ensures the extracted data conforms to a predefined structure.

### LangChain's Structured Output

- Leverages LLM's capabilities to extract specific information.

### Flexible Prompt Engineering

- Adapts prompts to various extraction tasks.

#### Multiple Entity Extraction

- Bash
  ```bash
  npm run multiple-entities
  ```

* Use code with caution.

## Project Structure

- `src/1-basic.ts`: Demonstrates extracting a single entity (person) from
  text.
- `src/2-multiple-entities.ts`: Shows how to extract multiple entities
  (people) from text.
