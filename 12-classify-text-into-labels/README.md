# Project: Text Classification with LangChain

This project demonstrates how to classify text into specific labels using
LangChain.

## Project Structure

### src/1-basic.ts

- This file introduces the fundamental concepts of text classification
  with LangChain.
- Defines a basic classification schema with sentiment, aggressiveness,
  and language labels.
- Utilizes a simple prompt to extract the desired information from the
  input text.
- Demonstrates how to use the ChatOpenAI model with structured output to
  obtain the classified results.

### src/2-finer-control.ts

- Builds upon the basic example, showcasing how to refine the
  classification schema for more granular control.
- Introduces a more detailed sentiment classification with "happy,"
  "neutral," and "sad" categories.
- Expands the aggressiveness scale to a range of 1 to 5.
- Incorporates a wider range of supported languages.
- Demonstrates how to handle multiple input texts and obtain their
  respective classifications.

## Key Concepts

### Prompt Engineering

- Crafting effective prompts to guide the LLM's response.
- Techniques for improving prompt engineering.

### Structured Output

- Using Zod schemas to define the desired output format.
- Benefits of structured output in text classification.
