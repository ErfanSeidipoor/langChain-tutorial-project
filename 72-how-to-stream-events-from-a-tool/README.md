# How to stream events from a tool

This project is based on the [How to stream events from a tool](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/tool_stream_events/)

This project is based on the LangChain documentation and provides a tutorial example of how to stream events from a tool.

## Description

---

This repository contains the source code for a simple LangChain application that demonstrates how to summarize input text using advanced techniques. The application uses the Ollama model from LangChain to generate summaries, and it streams events from the tool to display its status in real-time.

## Files

---

- `src/index.ts`: This file contains the main entry point of the application, which sets up the Ollama model and defines a tool that summarizes input text.
