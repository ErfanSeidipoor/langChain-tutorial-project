# How to do retrieval

This project is based on the [How to do retrieval](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/chatbots_retrieval/)

This is a Node.js project that demonstrates the use of LangChain, an open-source platform for building conversational AI models.

The project consists of two main scripts: `basic` and `query-transformation`. The `basic` script runs a simple example of using LangChain to retrieve information from a conversational model. The
`query-transformation` script runs a more advanced example that demonstrates how to use LangChain to perform query transformations on the conversational output.

Here's an overview of the project structure and files:

- `src/1-basic`: This directory contains the code for the basic example. It includes a script that runs a simple example of using LangChain to retrieve information from a conversational model.
- `src/2-query-transformation`: This directory contains the code for the query transformation example that runs an advanced example of using LangChain to
  perform query transformations on the conversational output.
