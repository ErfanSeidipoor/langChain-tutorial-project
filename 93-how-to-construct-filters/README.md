# How to construct filters

This project is based on the [How to construct filters](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/query_constructing_filters/)

This project is a demonstration of how to construct filters for the LangChain API using the ChromaTranslator. It showcases how to create a search query with optional parameters and filter results based on those parameters.

### `index.ts`

- This file demonstrates how to construct comparisons and filter results using the LangChain API.
- It defines a search schema with optional parameters for year, author, and more.
- The `constructComparisons` function generates an array of Comparisons based on the provided query.
- The `_filter` variable is created by combining these Comparisons with an AND operation.
- Finally, it uses the ChromaTranslator to visit this filter and log the resulting response.
