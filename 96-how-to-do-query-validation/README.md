# How to do query validation

This project is based on the [How to do query validation](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/sql_query_checking/)

This project demonstrates how to use Langchain, a Python-based library for building conversational AI models, to validate SQL queries.

### `src/index.ts`

This is the main entry point of our application. It sets up a database connection using TypeORM and creates a Langchain chain for validating SQL queries.
