# How to select examples by similarity

This code snippet creates an example selector for use in natural language processing (NLP) applications,
specifically with the `langchain` library. The example selector is used to select examples from a dataset that
match a given input query.

**Code Breakdown**

The code consists of three main parts:

1. **Example Data**: The first part defines an array of example objects (`examples`) that contain information
   about healthy food types.
2. **Custom Example Selector**: The second part defines a custom example selector class (`CustomExampleSelector`)
   that extends the `BaseExampleSelector` class from the `@langchain/core/example_selectors` module. This class is
   used to select examples from the dataset based on a given input query.
3. **Dynamic Prompt Generation**: The third part generates a dynamic prompt using the `FewShotPromptTemplate`
   class, which takes the custom example selector as an argument.

**Custom Example Selector**

The custom example selector class (`CustomExampleSelector`) has two main methods:

- `addExample(example: Example)`: Adds a new example to the dataset.
- `selectExamples(inputVariables: Example)`: Selects examples from the dataset that match the input query. This
  method iterates through each example, calculates the length difference between the input query and the first word
  of the example, and returns the best matching example.

**Dynamic Prompt Generation**

The dynamic prompt generation part uses the custom example selector to generate a prompt for the
`FewShotPromptTemplate` class. The generated prompt takes into account the input query, the prefix, and suffix
provided in the template.
