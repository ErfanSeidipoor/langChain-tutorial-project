# How to get log probabilities

This project demonstrates how to use the Langchain library, specifically with the OpenAI model, to retrieve log probabilities.

### Files Description

- `src/index.ts`: This file contains the main script that interacts with
  the OpenAI model. It imports the `ChatOpenAI` class from
  `@langchain/openai` and sets up a new instance of the model. The script
  then invokes the model, streaming responses to demonstrate log
  probabilities.
