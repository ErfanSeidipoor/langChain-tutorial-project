# How to split code

This project is based on the [How to split code](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/code_splitter/)

This repository provides an example of how to use LangChain's text splitter in different programming languages.

## Files

### src/1-js.ts

This file demonstrates how to use LangChain's text splitter in JavaScript. It creates a new instance of the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with the language set to "js", and then uses it to split a sample code
snippet.

### src/2-python.ts

Similarly, this file shows how to use LangChain's text splitter in Python. It creates a new instance of the `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` with the language set to "python", and then uses it to split a sample code
snippet.
