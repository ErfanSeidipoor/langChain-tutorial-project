# How to call tools with multimodal data

This project is based on the [How to call tools with multimodal data](https://js.langchain.com/docs/how_to/tool_calls_multimodal/)

This project demonstrates how to call tools with multimodal data using LangChain.

## Description

The `index.ts` file showcases an example of calling a tool with multimodal input data, specifically image data. It uses the `ChatOllama` model and defines a custom tool called "weather" that takes in weather information as input and returns it back to the user.
