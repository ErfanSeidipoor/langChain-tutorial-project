# How to force tool calling behavior

=============================

This project demonstrates how to force tool calling behavior using
LangChain.

## Description

This project uses LangChain to create a simple OpenAI Chat interface. It
shows two possible scenarios: one where the tool is chosen in advance, and
another where the user chooses which tool to use.

### src/index.ts

This file contains the main code of the project. It imports necessary
modules, defines tools for adding and multiplying numbers, and creates an
instance of the OpenAI Chat interface.
